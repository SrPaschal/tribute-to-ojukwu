    <h4>Ikemba Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu<br/>
        (November 4, 1933 - November 26, 2011)</h2>
        <small>We are humans. We live. We fight, fight because the decision to be free is a decision taken freely and collectively, because to become involved in violent struggle for freedom is the only honor left to an oppressed people threatened with genocide, because in the <br /> final analysis the only true bulwark against death is to live. Biafra rejects death…Biafra lives<br/>

        <h4>TIMELINE: NOTABLE LIFE HISTORY OF CHIEF CHUKWUEMEKA ODUMEGWU OJUKWU
        </h4>
    </center>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>Chief Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu</strong> was born on November 4, 1933, Zungeru, Nigeria and died on November 26, 2011, London, England</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">He was Nigerian military leader and politician, who was head of the secessionist state of Biafra during the Nigerian civil war</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Ojukwu was the son of a successful Igbo businessman. After graduating from the University of Oxford in 1955, he returned to Nigeria to serve as an administrative officer. After two years, however, he joined the army and was rapidly promoted thereafte</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">In January 1966 a group of largely Igbo junior army officers overthrew Nigerias civilian government but then were forced to hand power to the highest-ranking military officer, Maj. Gen. T.U. Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi (also an Igbo); he appointed Lieut. Col. <strong>Ojukwu</strong> as military governor of the mostly Igbo Eastern region</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">However, Hausa and Yoruba army officers from the Northern and Western regions feared a government dominated by the Igbo, and in July 1966 Northern officers staged a successful countercoup in which Lieut. Col. (later Gen.) Yakubu Gowon was installed as the new head of state</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Under Gowons rule, <strong>Ojukwu</strong> retained his command of the Eastern region. Meanwhile, the rising tide of feeling against the Igbo in the Northern region led to large-scale massacres of Igbos by Northerners in May to September 1966</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
        The Eastern region felt increasingly alienated from the federal military government under Gowon. Ojukwu's main proposal to end the ethnic strife was a significant devolution of power to the regions. The federal government initially agreed to this solution at a conference in January 1967 but then rejected it soon afterward</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>Ojukwu</strong> responded in March to April 1967 by separating the Eastern regional governments administration and revenues from those of the federal government. Mounting secessionist pressures from his fellow Igbo finally compelled Ojukwu on May 30, 1967, to declare the Eastern region an independent sovereign state as the Republic of Biafra.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Federal troops soon afterward invaded Biafra, and civil war broke out in July 1967</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>Ojukwu</strong> led Biafra's unsuccessful struggle to survive as an independent state throughout the civil war, and, on the eve of Biafra's surrender in 1970, he fled to Côte d'Ivoire, where he was granted asylum</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Ojukwu remained in exile until 1982, when he was pardoned and returned to Nigeria. He joined the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in January 1983 and subsequently attempted to reenter politics; his bid for the senate representing the state of Anambra was unsuccessful. He was detained for 10 months following a coup that brought Muhammadu Buhari to power at the end of 1983</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">In 1993 he once again joined a political party, this time the Social Democratic Party, but he was disqualified from running for president.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">As a member of constitutional conferences in 1993 and again from 1994 to 1995, he, along with other former Nigerian leaders, was consulted in 1998 by Abdusalam Abubakar, the military head of state, as Nigeria once again began the process of converting from military to civilian rule.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">In 2003 <strong>Ojukwu</strong>, representing a new political party that he helped form, the All Progressive Grand Alliance, unsuccessfully ran for president.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;">He ran again in 2007 but was defeated by the ruling party's candidate,
            Umaru Yar'Adua
            , in an election that was strongly criticized by international observers as being marred by voting irregularitie</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 16px;"><strong>Ojukwu</strong> had several honours and titles bestowed upon him during his life, including the honorary chieftaincy title <strong>Ikemba of Nnewi</strong></li>
